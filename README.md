# ShortcutColorDevtoolObject
## Requires Enum Extender
 Adds a devtool object that colors all shortcuts within radius into specified color
 The color is specified manually using RGB sliders

 These objects would not interact with each other, if you have two SC objects affecting a single dot, the dot would take the color of one of them, theoretically the last created

 To start working they require re-realizing the room (assumedly, I always tested them by going to main menu and back), but once they are rendered, they show the changes in real time
 
 Uses Henpemaz' Placed Object Manager for devtools interface
 
 This object will be integrated into RegionKit as soon as it gets updated to a less archaic state

 Special thanks to Henpemaz, Slime_Cubed, Drillboy Jenkins and Thalber
